        "abstract": "Water transport is an integral part of the process of growth by cell expansion and accounts for most of the increase in cell volume characterizing growth. Under water deficiency, growth is readily inhibited and growth of roots is favoured over that of leaves. The mechanisms underlying this differential response are examined in terms of Lockhart's equations and water transport. For roots, when water potential (Ψ) is suddenly reduced, osmotic adjustment occurs rapidly to allow partial turgor recovery and re‐establishment of Ψ gradient for water uptake, and the loosening ability of the cell wall increases as indicated by a rapid decline in yield‐threshold turgor. These adjustments permit roots to resume growth under low Ψ. In contrast, in leaves under reductions in Ψ of similar magnitude, osmotic adjustment occurs slowly and wall loosening ability either does not increase substantially or actually decreases, leading to …",

We examine the potential error contributions from meteorology, leaf area index (LAI)/fPAR, and land cover. The error between annual GPP computed from NASA's Data Assimilation Office's (DAO) and tower-based meteorology is 28%, indicating that NASA's DAO global meteorology plays an important role in the accuracy of the GPP algorithm. Approximately 62% of MOD15-based estimates of LAI were within the estimates based on field optical measurements, although remaining values overestimated site values.

To address this issue, fluxes of CO2 (Fc, flux toward the surface is negative) were measured over a Mediterranean, annual grassland in California, USA for 2 years with the eddy covariance method. To interpret the biotic and abiotic factors that modulate Fc over the course of a year we decomposed net ecosystem CO2 exchange into its constituent components, ecosystem respiration (Reco) and gross primary production (GPP). Daytime Reco was extrapolated from the relationship between temperature and nighttime Fc under high turbulent conditions. Then, GPP was estimated by subtracting daytime values of Fc from daytime estimates of Reco. Results show that most of carbon exchange …",

CMOS operating at cryogenic temperatures down to 4 K (cryo-CMOS) allows for closer system integration, thus promising a scalable solution to enable future quantum computers. In this paper, a cryogenic control system is proposed, along with the required specifications, for the interface of the classical electronics with the quantum processor. To prove the advantages of such a system, the functionality of key circuit blocks is experimentally demonstrated. The characteristic properties of cryo-CMOS are exploited to design a noise-canceling low-noise amplifier for spin-qubit RF-reflectometry readout and a class-F2,3 digitally controlled oscillator required to manipulate the state of qubits.",

The core of the system is an array of 32 /spl times/ 32 rangefinding pixels that independently measure the time-of-flight of a ray of light as it is reflected back from the objects in a scene. A single cone of pulsed laser light illuminates the scene, thus no complex mechanical scanning or expensive optical equipment are needed. Millimetric depth accuracies can be reached thanks to the rangefinder's optical detectors that enable picosecond time discrimination. The detectors, based on a single photon avalanche diode operating in Geiger mode, utilize avalanche multiplication to enhance light detection. On-pixel high-speed electrical amplification can therefore be eliminated, thus greatly simplifying the array and potentially reducing its power dissipation. Optical power requirements …",

Other features of the hand include an integrated sensing suite that uses a common transduction technology on flexible printed circuits for tactile and proprioceptive sensing.

Compliance in the fingers and transmission determines the degree of load-sharing among contacts and the hands’ ability to secure irregularly shaped objects. However, it can also decrease external grasp stiffness and acquisition reliability. SimGrasp, a flexible dynamic hand simulator, enables parametric studies of the hand for acquisition and pull-out tests with varying transmission spring rates. In the present application, we take advantage of achieving different stiffnesses by reversing the direction of tendon windup using a torsional spring-loaded winch. With this provision, the hand can be relatively soft for handling delicate objects and stiff for tasks requiring strength. Two hands were field …",

Pollinator and enemy richness directly supported ecosystem services in addition to and independent of abundance and dominance. Up to 50% of the negative effects of landscape simplification on ecosystem services was due to richness losses of service-providing organisms, with negative consequences for crop yields.

The main advantage of this concept is that no force sensor has to be integrated into surgical instruments and inserted into the patient's body.

Using an adaptive filter, which is among the most effective in determining trends of a signal, reducing noise, and performing fractal and multifractal analysis, we show that the energy of the smoothed sentiment signals decays with the smoothing parameter as a power-law, characterized by a Hurst parameter H of 1/2 <; H <; 1, which signifies long-range correlations. We further show that a smoothed sentiment arc corresponds to the sentiment of fast playing mode or sentiment retained in one's memory, and that for a novel to be both captivating and rich, H has to be larger than 1/2 but …",

An experimental implementation of our algorithm produces a single bit stream, from which suitable subsets are extracted to be compatible with many decoder frame sizes and frame rates and to satisfy transmission bandwidth constraints ranging from several tens of kilobits per second to several megabits per second. Reconstructed video quality from any of these bit stream subsets is often found to exceed that obtained from an MPEG-1 implementation, operated with equivalent bit rate constraints, in both perceptual quality and mean squared error. In addition, when restricted to 2-D, the algorithm produces some of the best results available in still image compression.<>",

The idea is to impose a number of constraints on the coded image in such a way as to restore it to its original artifact-free form. One such constraint can be derived by exploiting the fact that the transform-coded image suffering from blocking effects contains high-frequency vertical and horizontal artifacts corresponding to vertical and horizontal discontinuities across boundaries of neighboring blocks. Another constraint has to be with the quantization intervals of the transform coefficients. Specifically, the decision levels associated with transform coefficient quantizers can be used as lower and upper bounds on transform coefficients, which in turn define boundaries of the convex set for projection. A few examples of the proposed approach are presented.<>",

Fortunately, farmers and researchers have developed a thoroughly studied pathway to this transition: agroecological farming systems that mimic natural ecosystems, creating tightly coupled cycles of energy, water, and nutrients. A critical and underappreciated feature of agroecological systems is that they replace fossil fuel- and chemical -intensive management with knowledge-intensive management. Hence, the greatest sustainability challenge for agriculture may well be that of replacing non-renewable resources with ecologically-skilled people, and doing so in ways that create and support desirable rural livelihoods. Yet over the past century, US agriculture has been trending in the opposite direction, rapidly replacing knowledgeable people with non-renewable resources and eroding rural economies in the process. Below, we suggest how US policy could pivot to enable and support the ecologically skilled workforce needed to achieve food security in the face of climate change.",

We focus our comparisons on distinct organizational structures, resource flows, and policy activities. All but one of the 10 councils is organized as a multisector community collaborative, rather than as an independent nonprofit organization or a government advisory body. Each includes local government personnel as members and most depend on government resources for their operations, including meeting spaces, facilitation, information, and/or direct funding. All 10 councils feature regular meetings at which information is shared to build awareness, relationships, and trust, all of which can indirectly shape policy agendas and initiatives. This policy relevant work is feasible even for small councils with few resources. FPC leaders can also seize opportunities by considering the stages of the policy process they hope to influence, the types of policy issues they wish to address, the time frame it may take to realize different types of policy goals, and the degree to which they will seek incremental or more fundamental changes. We find that structural autonomy—being organized outside of the government while maintaining strong collaborations with the government—helps food policy councils retain their independence while promoting more inclusive policy making processes that link community members to the government.",

This thesis proposes a control system, the Last Planner system, that causes the realization of plans, and thus supplements project management’s concern for management of contracts with the management of production.  The Last Planner system has previously been successfully applied by firms with direct responsibility for production management; e.g., specialty contractors. This thesis extends system application to those coordinating specialists, both in design and construction, through a series of case studies, one of which also explores the limits of unilateral implementation by specialists.  In addition to the extended application, two questions drive this research. The first question is 1) What can be done by way of tools provided and improved implementation of the Last Planner system of production control to increase plan reliability above the 70% PPC level? Previous research revealed substantial improvement in productivity for those who improved plan reliability to the 70% level, consequently there is reason to hope for further improvement, possibly in all performance dimensions, especially with application across an entire project rather than limited to individual specialty firms. That question is explored in three case studies, the last of which achieved the 90% target.   The second question is 2) How/Can Last Planner be successfully applied to increase plan reliability during design processes. That question is explored in an extensive case study, which significantly contributes to understanding the design process from the perspective of active control, but …",

Construction has traditionally tried to improve competitiveness by making conversions incrementally more efficient. But judging from the manufacturing experience, construction could realize dramatic improvements simply by identifying and eliminating non conversion (non value-adding) activities.

Does such a theory add to our understanding and lead to improved performance when applied to construction? The answer to the first question is sought by reviewing the history of production thinking both from the scientific and the industrial points of view. Historical analysis reveals that three different conceptualizations of production have been used in practice and conceptually advanced in the 20th century. In the first conceptualization, production is viewed as a transformation of inputs to outputs. Production management equates to decomposing the total transformation into elementary transformations, tasks, and carrying out the tasks as efficiently as possible. The second conceptualization views production as a flow, where, in addition to transformation, there are waiting, inspection and moving stages. Production management equates to minimizing the share of non-transformation stages of the production flow, especially by reducing variability. The third conceptualization views production as a means for the fulfillment of the customer needs. Production management equates to translating these needs accurately into a design solution and then producing products that conform to the specified design. It is argued that all these conceptualizations are necessary, and they should be utilized simultaneously. The resulting transformation-flow-value generation model of production is called the TFV theory of production. It is noteworthy that this same new conceptualization also applies to product design and development, as revealed by a historical …",

        "abstract": "Rural Pennsylvania, the epicenter of the Marcellus Shale region, hosts the most prolific unconventional natural gas extraction and production activity in the US. Farmers of small and midsized operations in Marcellus counties depend increasingly on incomes from booming natural gas operations, while the industry needs their land to access energy resources. These farmers thus bridge two economic sectors—unconventional natural gas production and agriculture. Related dynamics rapidly transform the social, economic, and environmental landscapes for Pennsylvania's rural communities. We ask: What, if any, are the environmental justice implications of the unconventional natural gas industry's presence in rural agricultural spaces, particularly for farmers with small and midsized operations? Presenting findings from 42 in-depth interviews, participant observation, and archival analysis, we show how farmers benefit …",

        "abstract": "Recently, contract-based design has been proposed as an “orthogonal” approach that complements system design methodologies proposed so far to cope with the complexity of system design. Contract-based design provides a rigorous scaffolding for verification, analysis, abstraction/refinement, and even synthesis. A number of results have been obtained in this domain but a unified treatment of the topic that can help put contract-based design in perspective was missing. This monograph intends to provide such a treatment where contracts are precisely defined and characterized so that they can be used in design methodologies with no ambiguity. In particular, this monograph identifies the essence of complex system design using contracts through a mathematical “meta-theory”, where all the properties of the methodology are derived from a very abstract and generic notion of contract. We show that the meta-theory provides deep and illuminating links with existing contract and interface theories, as well as guidelines for designing new theories. Our study encompasses contracts for both software and systems, with emphasis on the latter. We illustrate the use of contracts with two examples: requirement engineering for a parking garage management, and the development of contracts for timing and scheduling in the context of the AUTOSAR methodology in use in the automotive sector.",

Furthermore, these techniques do not apply to multiprocessor architectures which are likely to be widely used in future microcontrollers. This paper presents a fast and simple algorithm for sharing resources in multiprocessor systems, together with an innovative procedure for assigning preemption thresholds to tasks.

While conventional rigid sensors work effectively for soft robotics in specific situations, sensors that are directly integrated into the bodies of soft robots could help improve both their exteroceptive and interoceptive capabilities. To address this challenge, we designed sensors that can be co-fabricated with soft robot bodies using commercial 3D printers, without additional modification. We describe an approach to the design and fabrication of compliant, resistive soft sensors using a Connex3 Objet350 multimaterial printer and investigated an analytical comparison to sensors of similar geometries. The sensors consist of layers of commercial photopolymers with varying conductivities.

We present the smart suction cup, an end effector that utilizes internal flow measurements for tactile sensing. We show that model-based haptic search methods, guided by these flow measurements, improve grasping success by up to 2.5× as compared with using only a vision planner during a bin-picking task.

        "abstract": "In the late nineteenth century, Scandinavian urban dwellers developed a passion for a new, utterly modern sort of visual spectacle: objects and effigies brought to life in astonishingly detailed, realistic scenes. The period 1880-1910 was the popular high point of mannequin display in Europe. Living Pictures, Missing Persons explores this phenomenon as it unfolded with the rise of wax museums and folk museums in the largest cities of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. Mark Sandberg asks: Why did modernity generate a cultural fascination with the idea of effigy? He shows that the idea of effigy is also a portal to understanding other aspects of visual entertainment in that period, including the widespread interest in illusionistic scenes and tableaux, in the\" portability\" of sights, spaces, and entire milieus. Sandberg investigates this transformation of visual culture outside the usual test cases of the largest European metropolises. He argues that Scandinavian spectators desired an unusual degree of authenticity--a cultural preference for naturalism that made its way beyond theater to popular forms of museum display. The Scandinavian wax museums and folk-ethnographic displays of the era helped pre-cinematic spectators work out the social implications of both voyeuristic and immersive display techniques. This careful study thus anticipates some of the central paradoxes of twentieth-century visual culture--but in a time when the mannequin and the physical relic reigned supreme, and in a place where the contrast between tradition and modernity was a high-stakes game.",

Sandberg concentrates on the interior dramas of the playwright's prose-play cycle, drawing also on his selected poems.

In contrast to previous studies, the correlation we report between the systematic components of earnings and returns is stable over time.

To illustrate current work structuring practice, we describe a case study involving the installation of door frames into walls in a prison. We analyze why various problems existed. To improve the work structuring effort, we apply the “five whys” to develop local and global fixes for the system of precast walls and door frames. The five whys is a technique to elicit alternative ways of structuring work without being constrained by contractual agreements, traditions, or trade boundaries. We discuss the importance of dimensional tolerances in construction and how these affect the handoff of work from one group of workers to the next. We argue that these constraints and tolerance management practices are so embedded that project participants can miss opportunities …",

        "abstract": "Work structuring means developing a project’s process design while trying to align engineering design, supply chain, resource allocation, and assembly efforts. The goal of work structuring is to make work flow more reliable and quick while delivering value to the customer. Current work structuring practices are driven by contracts, the history of trades, and the traditions of craft. As a result, they rarely consider alternatives for making the construction process more efficient. To illustrate current practice and the opportunities provided by work structuring, this case study discusses the installation of metal door frames at a prison project. Because the project is a correctional facility, the door frame installation process involves a special grouting procedure which makes the installation process less routine. Those involved recognized the difficulty of the situation but better solutions were impeded by normal practice. This case study thus provided the opportunity to illustrate how one may come up with alternative ways to perform the work without being constrained by contractual agreements and trade boundaries. By doing so, we illustrate what work structuring means. Local and global fixes for the system comprising walls and doors are explored. In addition, we discuss the importance of dimensional tolerances in construction and how these affect the handoff of work chunks from one production unit to the next.",

Many existing approaches that support ECM adopt a reductionistic perspective. This paper takes a novel approach by adopting a systemic perspective.

They evolve over time and are influenced by the interactions between supply and demand. Drought events and adaptation throughout the world have been documented in Yevjevich et al.(1983), Wilhite et al.(1987), and Wilhite (1993).A comparative study of drought policies (Wilhite, 1986) suggests that governments often respond to drought through crisis management rather than preplanned programs.

In response, increasing the general adaptive capacity of farming systems is essential. We identify two divergent strategies for building adaptive capacity. Simplifying processes seek to narrowly maximize production by shifting the basis of agricultural production toward centralized control of socially and ecologically homogenized systems. Diversifying processes cultivate social-ecological complexity in order to provide multiple ecosystem services, maintain management flexibility, and promote coordinated adaptation across levels. Through five primarily United States focused cases of distinct agricultural challenges—foodborne pathogens, drought, marginal lands, labor availability, and land access and tenure—we compare simplifying and diversifying responses to assess how these pathways differentially enhance or degrade the adaptive capacity of farming systems in the context of the triple threat. These cases show that diversifying processes can weave a form of broad and nimble adaptive capacity that is fundamentally distinct from the narrow and brittle adaptive capacity produced through simplification. We find that while there are structural limitations and tradeoffs to diversifying processes, adaptive capacity can be facilitated by empowering people and enhancing ecosystem functionality to proactively distribute resources and knowledge where needed and to nimbly respond to changing circumstances.

Estimation based on index properties is highly desirable due to its simplicity and low cost and would be the path of choice to the SWCC, provided the accuracy of the estimate were adequate. Whether measured or estimated, there is variability and uncertainty associated with the SWCC that in turn will directly impact any model for the unsaturated soil behavior that makes use of this relationship.

Fortunately, farmers and researchers have developed a thoroughly studied pathway to this transition: agroecological farming systems that mimic natural ecosystems, creating tightly coupled cycles of energy, water, and nutrients. A critical and underappreciated feature of agroecological systems is that they replace fossil fuel- and chemical -intensive management with knowledge-intensive management. Hence, the greatest sustainability challenge for agriculture may well be that of replacing non-renewable resources with ecologically-skilled people, and doing so in ways that create and support desirable rural livelihoods. Yet over the past century, US agriculture has been trending in the opposite direction, rapidly replacing knowledgeable people with non-renewable resources and eroding rural economies in the process. Below, we suggest how US policy could pivot to enable and support the ecologically skilled workforce needed to achieve food security in the face of climate change.",

By eliminating HWk (up to hundreds of thousands) hand-designed object candidates to N (eg 100) learnable proposals, Sparse R-CNN completely avoids all efforts related to object candidates design and many-to-one label assignment. More importantly, final predictions are directly output without non-maximum suppression post-procedure. Sparse R-CNN demonstrates accuracy, run-time and training convergence performance on par with the well-established detector baselines on the challenging COCO dataset, eg, achieving 45.0 AP in standard 3x training schedule and running at 22 fps using ResNet-50 FPN model.

They believed that improving a firm's environmental performance was a matter of regulatory compliance, an activity that added nothing but economic cost and legal and political complications to the corporate bottom line.Today, at the dawn of the 21st century, this set of assumptions is giving way. A new generation of leading-edge managers is starting to recognize that superior environmental performance can confer competitive advantage, rather than undercut it. These managers see that it is in their company's strategic interest to institute environmental management systems that help them reduce waste and manage environmental risk effectively, because this increases efficiency, cutting costs as well as protecting against environmental liabilities. More importantly, they are realizing that it is in their firm's strategic self-interest to identify and find ways to embrace the business opportunities inherent in taking a constructive approach to solving society's mounting environmental problems. To turn environmental problems into strategic opportunities, the managers who are furthest along this …",

Results indicate that knowledge acquired through production depreciates rapidly. The conventional measure of learning, cumulative output, significantly overstates the persistence of learning. There is some evidence that learning transfers across organizations: organizations beginning production later are more productive than those with early start dates. Once organizations begin production, however, they do not appear to benefit from learning in other organizations. The implications of the results for a theory of organizational learning are discussed. Managerial implications are described.",

Designers at that time realized that, compared to the scientists who were creating the new technologies, their processes for embedding those technologies in usable artifacts were less rigorous and explicit. 11 Further, as they were increasingly forced to work across disciplinary boundaries, they found a need to be more precise in describing their processes to the others with …",

Predicating our work on narrative theory, we present an automated pipeline for the discovery and description of the generative narrative frameworks of conspiracy theories that circulate on social media, and actual conspiracies reported in the news media. We base this work on two separate comprehensive repositories of blog posts and news articles describing the well-known conspiracy theory Pizzagate from 2016, and the New Jersey political conspiracy Bridgegate from 2013. Inspired by the qualitative narrative theory of Greimas, we formulate a graphical generative machine learning model where nodes represent actors/actants, and multi-edges and self-loops among nodes capture context-specific relationships. Posts and news items are viewed as samples of subgraphs of the hidden narrative framework network. The problem of reconstructing the underlying narrative structure is then posed as a latent model estimation problem. To derive the narrative frameworks in our target corpora, we automatically extract and aggregate the actants (people, places, objects) and their relationships from the posts and articles. We capture context specific actants and interactant relationships by developing a system of supernodes and subnodes. We use these to construct an actant-relationship network, which constitutes the underlying generative narrative framework for …",

First, linear programming assigns the optimal amounts of slack to gates based on power-delay sensitivity. Then, an optimal gate configuration, in terms of Vth and transistor sizes, is selected by an exhaustive local search. Benchmark results for the algorithm show 32% reduction in power consumption on average, compared to sizing only power minimization. There is up to a 57% reduction for some circuits. The flow can be extended to dual supply voltage libraries to yield further power savings.",

Approximation of this prior structure through simple, efficient hyperparameter optimization steps is sufficient to achieve these performance gains. The prior structure we advocate substantially increases the robustness of topic models to variations in the number of topics and to the highly skewed word frequency distributions common in natural language. Since this prior structure can be implemented using efficient algorithms that add negligible cost beyond standard inference techniques, we recommend it as a new standard for topic modeling.\"",

Granular Resistive Force Theory, or RFT, is a flexible, reduced-order model for predicting intrusion forces on bodies in granular media. 2D RFT describes the forces on a plate whose velocity and normal vectors lie in the same vertical plane. We introduce a 3D RFT method that projects the total velocity vector into two scenarios that can already be described by 2D RFT, which allows us to extend the model into 3D with minimal additional experimental characterization. We then superimpose these independently calculated forces, weighted by experimentally fit scaling factors, to determine the total force on the plate. When applied to discretized convex hulls, this method performs force estimates of arbitrary trajectories in 3D …",

Genetics-based evidence provides fundamental insights into the diversity, ecology, and origins of many biological systems, including the mutualisms between metazoan hosts and their micro-algal partners. A well-known example is the dinoflagellate endosymbionts (\"zooxanthellae\") that power the growth of stony corals and coral reef ecosystems. Once assumed to encompass a single panmictic species, genetic evidence has revealed a divergent and rich diversity within the zooxanthella genus Symbiodinium. Despite decades of reporting on the significance of this diversity, the formal systematics of these eukaryotic microbes have not kept pace, and a major revision is long overdue.

In addition, the diverse microbes that associate with corals have the capacity for more rapid change, potentially aiding the adaptation of long-lived corals. Here, we show that the microbiome of reef corals is different across thermally variable habitats and changes over time when corals are reciprocally transplanted. Exposing these corals to thermal bleaching conditions changes the microbiome for heat-sensitive corals, but not for heat-tolerant corals growing in habitats with natural high heat extremes. Importantly, particular bacterial taxa predict the coral host response in a short-term heat stress experiment. Such associations could result from parallel responses of the coral and the microbial community to living at high natural temperatures. A …",

Together they provide the calcium carbonate framework of coral reef ecosystems. The importance of the microbiome (i.e., bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses) to holobiont functioning has only recently been recognized. Given that growth and density of Symbiodinium within the coral host is highly dependent on nitrogen availability, nitrogen-cycling microbes may be of fundamental importance to the stability of the coral–algae symbiosis and holobiont functioning, in particular under nutrient-enriched and -depleted scenarios. We summarize what is known about nitrogen cycling in corals and conclude that disturbance of microbial nitrogen cycling may be tightly linked to coral bleaching and disease.",

A gap exists between these in vivo experiments and the maturing academic theory of scale. The concept of ‘sovereignty’ can be opened up to reveal that movements, peoples, and communities, for example, are creating multiple sovereignties and are exercising sovereignty in more relational ways. Relational scale can aid movements and scholars to map and evaluate how spatial and temporal processes at and among various levels work to reinforce dominant agri-food systems but could also be reconfigured to support progressive alternatives …",

Fortunately, farmers and researchers have developed a thoroughly studied pathway to this transition: agroecological farming systems that mimic natural ecosystems, creating tightly coupled cycles of energy, water, and nutrients. A critical and underappreciated feature of agroecological systems is that they replace fossil fuel- and chemical -intensive management with knowledge-intensive management. Hence, the greatest sustainability challenge for agriculture may well be that of replacing non-renewable resources with ecologically-skilled people, and doing so in ways that create and support desirable rural livelihoods. Yet over the past century, US agriculture has been trending in the opposite direction, rapidly replacing knowledgeable people with non-renewable resources and eroding rural economies in the process. Below, we suggest how US policy could pivot to enable and support the ecologically skilled workforce needed to achieve food security in the face of climate change.",

However, we believe that a leading cause of non-reproducibility has not yet been adequately addressed: statistical standards of evidence for claiming new discoveries in many fields of science are simply too low. Associating statistically significant findings with P< 0.05 results in a high rate of false positives even in the absence of other experimental, procedural and reporting problems.For fields where the threshold for defining statistical significance for new discoveries is P< 0.05, we propose a change to P< 0.005.

        "abstract": "The eddy covariance technique ascertains the exchange rate of CO2 across the interface between the atmosphere and a plant canopy by measuring the covariance between fluctuations in vertical wind velocity and CO2 mixing ratio. Two decades ago, the method was employed to study CO2 exchange of agricultural crops under ideal conditions during short field campaigns. During the past decade the eddy covariance method has emerged as an important tool for evaluating fluxes of carbon dioxide between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere over the course of a year, and more. At present, the method is being applied in a nearly continuous mode to study carbon dioxide and water vapor exchange at over a hundred and eighty field sites, worldwide. The objective of this review is to assess the eddy covariance method as it is being applied by the global change community on increasingly longer time scales …",

Comparator thermal noise is, however, a limiting factor for the achievable resolution of several ADC architectures with scaled supply voltages. While mismatch in these comparators can be compensated for by calibration, noise can irreparably hinder performance and is less straightforward to be accounted for at design time. This paper presents a method to estimate the input referred noise in fully dynamic regenerative comparators leveraging a reference architecture. A time-domain analysis is proposed that accounts for the time varying nature of the circuit exploiting some basic results from the solution of stochastic differential equations.

Intrinsically a combinatorial problem, secure state estimation has been traditionally addressed either by brute force search, suffering from scalability issues, or via convex relaxations, using algorithms that can terminate in polynomial time but are not necessarily sound. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm that uses a satisfiability modulo theory approach to harness the complexity of secure state estimation. We leverage results from formal methods over real numbers to provide guarantees on the soundness and completeness of our algorithm. Moreover, we discuss its scalability properties, by providing upper bounds on the runtime performance.

While this approach offers opportunities to reduce downstream waste and improve value generation, it increases coordination complexity during design due to the increased number of participants in the design team.

In a case study we document the coordination mechanisms of a design organization on a large-scale construction project, being delivered under an Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) type contract, the Integrated Form of Agreement (IFOA). We conduct a Social Network Analysis (SNA) of information flow between people on the project, who work in a big-room environment. Analysis of this IPD-based social network with indices of degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and clustering, yields the following results:(1) the Chief Engineer and leaders of cross-functional teams play key roles in the coordination between teams,(2) people take on coordination jobs, even if it is not part of their formal role, and (3) IPD projects foster cross-functional collaboration.

        "abstract": "Standardization of work as an essential principle of lean management aims to improve the production process in construction. This paper describes a design strategy which aims to reduce the variety of building components, where this variety affects productivity negatively. The design strategy is based on modularization and standardization. We first review the roots of modularization and standardization, and distinguish the two concepts from each other. Then, we describe the design strategy, which is based on structuring of a building model and defining “modules”. The modeling strategy is implemented in two interrelated steps:(1) modularization, and (2) standardization.(1) The process of modularization defines' chunks' in the building’s model and the interfaces between them.(2) The process of standardization aligns the structure of the modules to reduce the variety of components. Creation of these standardized modules during design improves application of standardized work and pre-fabrication. We present the described design strategy in two case studies: The first case study presents an example of implementing the design methodology, and the second case study describes the results of the design methodology in reducing the variety of the components. We conclude that modularization improves the potential for standardization in one-off projects, but it should be applied (1) early in design and (2) in an integrated team to identify customer value trade-offs.",

This paper focuses on the structural complexity of information flow, and on the identification of root causes of the resulting rework. We propose that one can identify root causes for rework in the design phase of a project by (1) making actual information flow transparent and by (2) comparing actual information flow to planned information flow. After identifying misalignments between actual-and planned information flow, one can find their root causes, and then address those causes in order to reduce rework in design. We use a Multi Domain Matrix to deduce actual (‘As is’) and planned (‘Should’) information flow and then apply the Delta-Design Structure Matrix to compare the structures of the ‘Should-’with the ‘As is’ perspective. The proposed hypotheses,“Comparing structural complexity between the ‘Should-’and the ‘As is’ perspective helps to identify misalignments” and “Reduction of misalignments between actualand planned information flow reduces rework in design” were tested during the detailed design phase of a project. The Multi Domain Matrix and Design Structure Matrix were successfully applied: comparison of structural complexity aided in making actual information flow transparent and in reducing rework.",

Latency-insensitive designs are synchronous distributed systems and are realized by composing functional modules that exchange data on communication channels according to an appropriate protocol. The protocol works on the assumption that the modules are stallable, a weak condition to ask them to obey. The goal of the protocol is to guarantee that latency-insensitive designs composed of functionally correct modules behave correctly independently of the channel latencies. This allows us to increase the robustness of a design implementation because any delay variations of a channel can be \"recovered\" by changing the channel latency while the overall system functionality remains unaffected.

We renew their call to avoid using the DT measure because it is affected unexpectedly by two empirical regularities—namely, scale is negatively related to (1) deflated mean earnings and (2) variance of stock returns. Even though these regularities are unrelated to conditional conservatism, their joint effect is substantial and pervasive. More importantly, prior findings regarding time-series and cross-sectional variation in differential timeliness are confounded by corresponding variation in these regularities.",

In response, increasing the general adaptive capacity of farming systems is essential. We identify two divergent strategies for building adaptive capacity. Simplifying processes seek to narrowly maximize production by shifting the basis of agricultural production toward centralized control of socially and ecologically homogenized systems. Diversifying processes cultivate social-ecological complexity in order to provide multiple ecosystem services, maintain management flexibility, and promote coordinated adaptation across levels. Through five primarily United States focused cases of distinct agricultural challenges—foodborne pathogens, drought, marginal lands, labor availability, and land access and tenure—we compare simplifying and diversifying responses to assess how these pathways differentially enhance or degrade the adaptive capacity of farming systems in the context of the triple threat. These cases show that diversifying processes can weave a form of broad and nimble adaptive capacity that is fundamentally distinct from the narrow and brittle adaptive capacity produced through simplification. We find that while there are structural limitations and tradeoffs to diversifying processes, adaptive capacity can be facilitated by empowering people and enhancing ecosystem functionality to proactively distribute resources and knowledge where needed and to nimbly respond to changing circumstances. Our cases suggest that, in order to garner the most adaptive benefits from diversification, farming systems should balance the pursuit of multiple goals …",

To optimize these measures, we propose a new scheme called energy aware routing that uses sub-optimal paths occasionally to provide substantial gains. Simulation results are also presented that show increase in network lifetimes of up to 40% over comparable schemes like directed diffusion routing. Nodes also burn energy in a more equitable way across the network ensuring a more graceful degradation of service with time.",

A combination of meta‐analysis and tree physiological models demonstrate that optimal carbon allocation after drought explains observed patterns of delayed tree mortality and provides a predictive recovery framework.

Results show that tactile sensing data, in combination with information about the motor torque and robot gait, are sufficient to distinguish among hard, slippery, grassy and granular terrain types with>90% accuracy in a single stride. The most useful classifier features include stride frequency, peak motor torque, and peak and average tactile sensor readings.",

In this article, we designed thin, robust capacitive tactile sensors and applied them to the feet of a small hexapod with C-shaped rotating legs. The sensors measure contact forces as the robot traverses different types of terrain including hard surfaces with high or low friction, sand, and grass. Different gaits perform best on different types of terrain. Useful measured parameters include the magnitude and timing of the peak normal forces, in combination with the leg rotational velocity. The measured parameters were used in a support vector machine classifier to identify terrain types with 82.5% accuracy.

Although progress has been made in understanding the phenomenon, there still remain significant gaps, both in its fundamental theory and in numerical techniques for its characterisation. In this paper, we develop a solid foundation for phase noise that is valid for any oscillator, regardless of operating mechanism. We establish novel results about the dynamics of stable nonlinear oscillators in the presence of perturbations, both deterministic and random. We obtain an exact, nonlinear equation for phase error, which we solve without approximations for random perturbations. This leads us to a precise characterisation of timing jitter and spectral dispersion, for computing which we develop efficient numerical methods. We demonstrate our techniques on practical electrical oscillators, and obtain good …",

Shot and thermal noise sources in oscillators can be modeled as white-noise sources for all practical purposes.

        "abstract": "Neuroscience investigations are most often focused on the prediction of future perception or decisions based on prior brain states or stimulus presentations. However, the brain can also process information retroactively, such that later stimuli impact conscious percepts of the stimuli that have already occurred (called “postdiction”). Postdictive effects have thus far been mostly unimodal (such as apparent motion), and the models for postdiction have accordingly been limited to early sensory regions of one modality. We have discovered two related multimodal illusions in which audition instigates postdictive changes in visual perception. In the first illusion (called the “Illusory Audiovisual Rabbit”), the location of an illusory flash is influenced by an auditory beep-flash pair that follows the perceived illusory flash. In the second illusion (called the “Invisible Audiovisual Rabbit”), a beep-flash pair following a real flash suppresses the perception of the earlier flash. Thus, we showed experimentally that these two effects are influenced significantly by postdiction. The audiovisual rabbit illusions indicate that postdiction can bridge the senses, uncovering a relatively-neglected yet critical type of neural processing underlying perceptual awareness. Furthermore, these two new illusions broaden the Double Flash Illusion, in which a single real flash is doubled by two sounds. Whereas the double flash indicated that audition can create an illusory flash, these rabbit illusions expand audition’s influence on vision to the suppression of a real flash and the relocation of an illusory flash. These new additions to auditory-visual interactions indicate a spatio-temporally fine …",

We characterize the friction of soft skins, with varying size, and therefore bending stiffness, of cylindrical features, all with the same nominal contact area. In addition, a new method of frustrated total internal reflection with dye is introduced to visualize lubricated contact. We find that a small number of milliscale fingertip features maximizes friction force in the presence of lubrication, as compared both to un-patterned and many-featured skin designs.

In part, this is because many humanities graduate programs neither consider data skills a prerequisite, nor train their students in data analysis methods.  As the ‘laboratory for the humanities,’ libraries are uniquely suited to host new forms of collaborative exploration of big data by humanists. But in order to do this successfully, libraries must consider three challenges:  1) How to evolve technical infrastructure to support the analysis, not just the presentation, of digitized artifacts.  2) How to work with data that may fall under both copyright and licensing restrictions.  3) How to serve as trusted partners with disciplines that have evolved thoughtful critiques of quantitative and algorithmic methodologies.",

Unlike the reception of the Swedish author Jonas Khemiri’s first novel, Ett öga rött, in 2003, none of the works in Nye Stemmer seems to have heralded a new way of writing about identity.“Hvis man forventer, at den nydanske litteratur, der nu er på vej, vil være skræmmende og enormt fremmedartet, så bliver man, at dømme efter disse bidrag, skuffet,” noted reviewer and editor Christian B. Korsgaard.“De var bare stille og roligt godt lavet.” 5 Some contributions, such as Nassrin el Halawani’s “Den et niske lov,” took their cues from Langvad’s re-appropriation of legalistic language to describe the iron-clad laws of ethnic performance in Danish society:“Paragraf 3: Én gang etnisk, altid etnisk/Paragraf 3a: Ingen kan tage den etniskes borgerrettigheder som etnisk fra den etniske/Paragraf 3b: Den etniske kan ikke frasige sig sin etnicitet.” This similarity between El Halawani’s and Langvad’s style suggests that",

Using a unique sample of U.S. consulting contracts and a negative shock to trust between shareholders/managers (principals) and consultants (agents) staggered across space and over time, we find that lower trust increases contract completeness. Not only the complexity but also the verifiable states of the world covered by contracts increase after trust drops. The results hold for several novel text-analysis-based measures of contract completeness and do not arise in falsification tests. At the clause level, we find that non-compete agreements, confidentiality, indemnification, and termination rules are the most likely clauses added to contracts after a negative shock to trust and these additions are not driven by new boilerplate contract templates. These clauses are those whose presence should be sensitive to the mutual trust between principals and agents.",

This problem goes back to the 1950s and was first related to the identifiability problem for hidden Markov models, then to the determination of internal structures for compartmental systems and later embedded in the more general framework of positive systems theory. Within this framework, developing some ideas sprang in the 1960s, during the 1980s, the positive realization problem was reformulated in terms of a geometric condition which was recently exploited as a tool for finding the solution to the existence problem and providing partial answers to the minimality problem. In this paper, the reader is carried through the key ideas which have proved to be useful in order to tackle this problem. In …",

However, the ever increasing demands on passengers' comfort, safety, emissions, and fuel consumption imposed by car manufacturers and regulations call for more robust techniques and the use of cycle-accurate models. We argue that these models must be hybrid because of the combination of time-domain and event-based behaviors. We present a hybrid model of the engine in which both continuous and discrete time-domain as well as event-based phenomena are modeled in a separate but integrated manner. Based on this model, we formalize the specification of the overall engine control by defining a number of hybrid control problems. To cope with the difficulties arising in the design of hybrid controllers, a design …",

Phenology also controls many feedbacks of vegetation to the climate system by influencing the seasonality of albedo, surface roughness length, canopy conductance, and fluxes of water, energy, CO2 and biogenic volatile organic compounds. In this review, we first discuss the environmental drivers of phenology, and the impacts of climate change on phenology, in different biomes. We then examine the vegetation-climate feedbacks that are mediated by phenology, and assess the potential impact on these feedbacks of shifts in phenology driven by climate change. We finish with an overview of phenological modeling and we suggest ways in which models might be improved using existing data sets. Several key weaknesses in our current understanding emerge from this analysis. First, we need a better understanding of the drivers of phenology, particularly …",

Synthesis of four global climate datasets reveals a sharp increase of VPD after the late 1990s. In response, the vegetation greening trend indicated by a satellite-derived vegetation index (GIMMS3g), which was evident before the late 1990s, was subsequently stalled or reversed. Terrestrial gross primary production derived from two satellite-based models (revised EC-LUE and MODIS) exhibits persistent and widespread decreases after the late 1990s due to increased VPD, which offset the positive CO2 fertilization effect. Six Earth system models have consistently projected continuous increases of VPD throughout the current century.

        "abstract": "Embedded systems are informally defined as a collection of programmable parts surrounded by ASICs and other standard components, that interact continuously with an environment through sensors and actuators. The programmable parts include micro-controllers and Digital Signal Processors (DSPs). Embedded systems are often used in life-critical situations, where reliability and safety are more important criteria than performance. Today, embedded systems are designed with an ad hoc approach that is heavily based on earlier experience with similar products and on manual design. Use of higher-level languages such as C helps structure the design somewhat, but with increasing complexity it is not sufficient. Formal verification and automatic synthesis of implementations are the surest ways to guarantee safety. Thus, the POLIS system which is a co-design environment for embedded systems is based on a formal model of computation. POLIS was initiated in 1988 as a research project at the University of California at Berkeley and, over the years, grew into a full design methodology with a software system supporting it. Hardware-Software Co-Design of Embedded Systems: The POLIS Approach is intended to give a complete overview of the POLIS system including its formal and algorithmic aspects. Hardware-Software Co-Design of Embedded Systems: The POLIS Approach will be of interest to embedded system designers (automotive electronics, consumer electronics and telecommunications), micro-controller designers, CAD developers and students.",

The second contribution is explaining why CBA is superior to AHP for this context. In summary, CBA (1) provides a more context-based analysis than AHP, (2) does not incorporate conflicting judgments for weighing factors as AHP does, (3) does not assume linear trade-offs between factors as AHP does, (4) does not assume that factors have zero as a natural scale as AHP does, (5) focuses on differentiating between alternatives more than AHP, (6) maintains the result of the decision …",

Traditionally, several multi-criteria decision-making approaches have been applied, with the most often used being the analytical hierarchical process (AHP). However, AHP allows users to offset poor environmental and/or social performance with low cost. To overcome this limitation, our study examines a choosing-by-advantages (CBA) approach to rank seven WWT technologies for secondary WWT. CBA results were compared with results obtained by using the AHP approach. The rankings of WWT alternatives differed, depending on whether the CBA or AHP approach was used, which highlights the importance of the method used to support decision-making processes, particularly ones that rely on subjective …",

Moreover, the interaction with increasing numbers of stakeholders makes decision-making even more complex. While decisions can be supported by decision-making methods, in practice many are made without a formal method or discussion, which often generates conflict and waste in the design process.

Making sound design decisions aids in successful implementation of set-based design. This paper explores the use of CBA to select a design for steel reinforcement, aka. rebar, in a beam-column joint. CBA, in conjunction with set-based design, allows the engineer to explicitly consider multiple design alternatives that meet various ‘must’and ‘want’criteria. The factors and criteria developed to evaluate the design alternatives reflect the values of the various project team members involved in rebar design and construction. Because decision-making is subjective, it is important to document why and on what basis decisions are made so they can be revisited at a later time on that project, should new considerations or facts become available, and on future projects. Decision-makers using CBA list the attributes and advantages (the beneficial difference between two alternatives) of each alternative and then assign a degree of importance to each advantage relative to the one that is least preferred. The example presented herein shows that team member values may conflict, but including all perspectives in the CBA table enriches the decision-making process and cultivates a shared understanding among project team members.",

Essentially, these typical processes reproduce already existing data, ie building models already created by the architect. Accordingly, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) developed a semi-automated process that enables reproducible conversions of Building Information Model (BIM) representations of building geometry into a format required by building energy modeling (BEM) tools. This is a generic process that may be applied to all building energy modeling tools but to date has only been used for EnergyPlus.This report describes and demonstrates each stage in the semi-automated process for building geometry using the recently constructed NASA Ames Sustainability Base throughout. This example uses ArchiCAD (Graphisoft, 2012) as the originating CAD tool and EnergyPlus as the concluding whole building energy simulation tool. It is important to note that the process is also applicable for professionals that use other CAD tools such as Revit (“Revit Architecture,” 2012) and DProfiler (Beck Technology, 2012) and can be extended to provide geometry definitions for BEM tools other than EnergyPlus. Geometry Simplification Tool (GST) was used during the NASA Ames project and was the enabling software that facilitated semi-automated data transformations.

In particular, we analyse the effect of the extrapolation of night‐time values of ecosystem respiration into the daytime; this is usually done with a temperature response function that is derived from long‐term data sets. For this analysis, we used 16 one‐year‐long data sets of carbon dioxide exchange measurements from European and US‐American eddy covariance networks. These sites span from the boreal to Mediterranean climates, and include deciduous and evergreen forest, scrubland and crop ecosystems.We show that the temperature sensitivity of Reco, derived from long‐term (annual) data sets, does not reflect the short‐term temperature sensitivity that is effective when …",

Tropical forests and savannahs account for 60%. GPP over 40% of the vegetated land is associated with precipitation. State-of-the-art process-oriented biosphere models used for climate predictions exhibit a large between-model variation of GPP’s latitudinal patterns and show higher spatial correlations between GPP and precipitation, suggesting the existence of missing processes or feedback mechanisms which attenuate the vegetation response to climate. Our estimates of spatially distributed GPP and its covariation with climate can help improve coupled climate–carbon cycle process models.",

In their comments about a novel, readers generally include only a subset of characters and their relationships, thus offering a limited perspective on that work.

We represent this framework in the form of an actant-relationship story graph. Extracting this graph is a challenging computational problem, which we pose as a latent graphical model estimation problem.

We contend that it is possible to precisely point out the underlying theoretical foundation of project management as espoused in the PMBOK Guide by PMI and mostly applied in practice. This foundation can be divided into a theory of project and a theory of management. We link theories to the body of knowledge by comparing prescriptions derived from theory to prescriptions presented in the PMBOK. Secondly, we show, by a comparison to competing theories and by an analysis of anomalies (deviations from assumptions or outcomes as implied in the body of knowledge) observed in project management practice, that this foundation is obsolete and has to be substituted by a wider and more powerful theoretical foundation.",

Energy balance closure was evaluated by statistical regression of turbulent energy fluxes (sensible and latent heat (LE)) against available energy (net radiation, less the energy stored) and by solving for the energy balance ratio, the ratio of turbulent energy fluxes to available energy. These methods indicate a general lack of closure at most sites, with a mean imbalance in the order of 20%. The imbalance was prevalent in all measured vegetation types and in climates ranging from Mediterranean to temperate and arctic. There were no clear differences between sites using open and closed path infrared gas analyzers. At a majority of sites closure improved with turbulent intensity …",

Until such evidence is available, changes in the water cycle on land—a key diagnostic criterion of the effects of climate change and variability—remain uncertain.

The uniqueness of materials and locations combined with the unpredictability in duration and variation in execution quality of various steps in the supply chain allow for different ways to sequence material delivery and work area completion. Several alternatives are described. Their impact on process execution is illustrated by means of probabilistic process models.

Production-level detail, describing resources being passed from one trade to the next, illustrates that throughput will be reduced, project completion delayed, and waste increased by variations in flow. The game shows that it is possible to reduce waste and shorten project duration by reducing the variability in work flow between trades. Basic production management concepts are thus applied to construction management. They highlight two shortcomings of using the critical-path method for field-level planning: The critical-path method makes modeling the dependence of ongoing activities between trades or with operations unwieldy and it …",

Curiously, these alternative titles point to no common feature, except one: novellas seem to be defined with respect to other genres. This is perhaps most true of the rapprochement of the novella and the short novel, which has proven so intuitive that its comparative nature is often forgotten and “novella” used interchangeably with “short novel.” On the contrary, a novella and a novel, however long or short, are very different things.

In order to explain their rapid ascent to such importance, Florian Fuchs identifies an essential role of literature, a role traditionally performed within classical civic discourse of storytelling, by looking at new or updated forms of this civic practice in modernity. Fuchs's focus in this groundbreaking book is on the fate of topical speech, on what is exchanged between participants in argument or conversation as opposed to rhetorical speech, which emanates from and ensures political authority. He shows how after the decline of the Ars topica in the eighteenth century, various forms of literary speech took up the role of topical speech that Aristotle had originally identified. Thus, his book outlines a genealogy of various literary short forms—from fable, fairy tale, and novella to twenty-first century video storytelling—that attempted on both\" high\" and\" low\" levels of culture to exercise again the social function of topical speech. Some of the specific texts analyzed include the novellas of Theodor Storm and the novella-like lettre de cachet, proverbial fictions of Gustave Flaubert and Gottfried Keller, the fairy tale as rediscovered by Vladimir Propp and Walter Benjamin, the epiphanies of James Joyce, and the video narratives of Hito Steyerl.",

Selection demands were varied across three semantic tasks in a single group of subjects. Functional magnetic resonance imaging signal in overlapping regions of left IFG was dependent on selection demands in all three tasks. In addition, the degree of semantic processing was varied independently of selection demands in one of the tasks. The absence of left IFG activity for this comparison counters the argument that the effects of selection can be attributed solely to variations in degree of semantic retrieval.

Although the prefrontal cortex is activated during both verbal and spatial passive working memory tasks2–8, the brain regions involved in the CES component of working memory have not been identified. We have used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine brain activation during the concurrent performance of two tasks, which is expected to engage the CES.

        "abstract": "This paper quantifies how variation in economic activity and inflation in the United States influences the market prices of level, slope, and curvature risks in Treasury markets. We develop a novel arbitrage‐free dynamic term structure model in which bond investment decisions are influenced by output and inflation risks that are unspanned by (imperfectly correlated with) information about the shape of the yield curve. Our model reveals that, between 1985 and 2007, these risks accounted for a large portion of the variation in forward terms premiums, and there was pronounced cyclical variation in the market prices of level and slope risks.",

To establish these results, we develop a novel canonical GDTSM in which the pricing factors are observable portfolios of yields. For our normalization, standard maximum likelihood algorithms converge to the global optimum almost instantaneously. We present empirical estimates and out-of-sample forecasts for several GDTSMs using data on U.S. Treasury bond yields.",

At the same time, difficulties in inference regarding both the likelihood and severity of disasters, as well as agency problems, can lead to significant disagreements among investors about disaster risk. We show that such disagreements generate strong risk-sharing motives, such that just a small number of optimists in the economy will significantly reduce the disaster risk premium. Our model highlights the “latent” nature of disaster risk. The disaster risk premium will likely be low and smooth during normal times but increases dramatically when the risk-sharing capacity of the optimists is reduced, e.g., following a disaster. The model also helps reconcile the difference in the amount of disaster risk implied by financial markets and international macroeconomic data, and provides caution to the approach of extracting disaster probabilities from …",

However, the distribution and quantity of the training data on the clients' side may lead to significant challenges such as class imbalance and non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data, which could greatly impact the performance of the common model. While much effort has been devoted to helping FL models converge when encountering non-IID data, the imbalance issue has not been sufficiently addressed. In particular, as FL training is executed by exchanging gradients in an encrypted form, the training data is not completely observable to either clients or server, and previous methods for class imbalance do not perform well for FL. Therefore, it is crucial to design new methods for detecting class imbalance in FL and mitigating its impact. In this work, we propose a monitoring scheme that can infer the composition of training data for each FL round, and design a new loss function--Ratio Loss to mitigate the impact of the imbalance. Our experiments demonstrate the importance of acknowledging class imbalance and taking measures as early as possible in FL training, and the effectiveness of our method in mitigating the impact. Our method is shown to significantly outperform previous methods, while maintaining client privacy.",

        "abstract": "The explosive growth of embedded electronics is bringing information and control systems of increasing complexity to every aspects of our lives. The most challenging designs are safety-critical systems, such as transportation systems (eg, airplanes, cars, and trains), industrial plants and health care monitoring. The difficulties reside in accommodating constraints both on functionality and implementation. The correct behavior must be guaranteed under diverse states of the environment and potential failures; implementation has to meet cost, size, and power consumption requirements. The design is therefore subject to extensive mathematical analysis and simulation. However, traditional models of information systems do not interface well to the continuous evolving nature of the environment in which these devices operate. Thus, in practice, different mathematical representations have to be mixed to analyze the overall behavior of the system. Hybrid systems are a particular class of mixed models that focus on the combination of discrete and continuous subsystems. There is a wealth of tools and languages that have been proposed over the years to handle hybrid systems. However, each tool makes different assumptions on the environment, resulting in somewhat different notions of hybrid system. This makes it difficult to share information among tools. Thus, the community cannot maximally leverage the substantial amount of work that has been directed to this important topic. In this paper, we review and compare hybrid system tools by highlighting their differences in terms of their underlying semantics, expressive power and mathematical …",

During the preliminary phases of these projects, the impor tance of logic minimization for the synthesis of area and performance effective circuits clearly emerged. In 1980, Richard Newton stirred our interest by pointing out new heuristic algorithms for two-level logic minimization and the potential for improving upon existing approaches. In the summer of 1981, the authors organized and participated in a seminar on logic manipulation at IBM Research. One of the goals of the seminar was to study the literature on logic minimization and to look at heuristic algorithms from a fundamental and comparative point of view. The fruits of this investigation were surprisingly abundant: it was apparent from an initial implementation of recursive logic minimiza tion (ESPRESSO-I) that, if we merged our new results into a two-level minimization program, an important step forward in automatic logic synthesis could result. ESPRESSO-II was born and an APL implemen tation was created in the summer of 1982. The results of preliminary tests on a fairly large set of industrial examples were good enough to justify the publication of our algorithms. It is hoped that the strength and speed of our minimizer warrant its Italian name, which denotes both express delivery and a specially-brewed black coffee.",

MIS starts from the combinational logic extracted, typically, from a high-level description of a macrocell. It produces a multilevel set of optimized logic equations preserving the input-output behavior. The system includes both fast and slower (but more optimal) versions of algorithms for minimizing the area, and global timing optimization algorithms to meet system-level timing constraints. This paper provides an overview of the system and a description of the algorithms used. Included are some examples illustrating an input language used for specifying logic and don't-cares. Parts on an industrial chip have been re-synthesized using MIS with favorable results as compared to equivalent manual designs.",

        "abstract": "To construct sophisticated biochemical circuits from scratch, one needs to understand how simple the building blocks can be and how robustly such circuits can scale up. Using a simple DNA reaction mechanism based on a reversible strand displacement process, we experimentally demonstrated several digital logic circuits, culminating in a four-bit square-root circuit that comprises 130 DNA strands. These multilayer circuits include thresholding and catalysis within every logical operation to perform digital signal restoration, which enables fast and reliable function in large circuits with roughly constant switching time and linear signal propagation delays. The design naturally incorporates other crucial elements for large-scale circuitry, such as general debugging tools, parallel circuit preparation, and an abstraction hierarchy supported by an automated circuit compiler.",

Robots are an important type of molecular machine that automatically carry out complex nanomechanical tasks. DNA molecules are excellent materials for building molecular robots, because their geometric, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties are well understood and highly programmable. So far, the development of DNA robots has been limited to simple functions. Most DNA robots were designed to perform a single function: walking in a controlled direction. A few demonstrations included a second function combined with walking (for example, picking up nanoparticles or choosing a path at a junction). However, these relatively more complex functions were also more difficult to control, and the complexity of the tasks was limited to what the robot can perform …",

This article investigates the construction of learned convolutional architectures for instrument recognition, given a limited amount of annotated training data. In this context, we benchmark three different weight sharing strategies for deep convolutional networks in the time-frequency domain: temporal kernels; time-frequency kernels; and a linear combination of time-frequency kernels which are one octave apart, akin to a Shepard pitch spiral. We provide an acoustical interpretation of these strategies within the source-filter framework of quasi-harmonic sounds with a fixed spectral envelope, which are archetypal of musical notes. The best classification accuracy is obtained by hybridizing all three convolutional layers into a single deep learning architecture.",

        "abstract": "Although a great deal of attention has been paid to how conspiracy theories circulate on social media, and the deleterious effect that they, and their factual counterpart conspiracies, have on political institutions, there has been little computational work done on describing their narrative structures. Predicating our work on narrative theory, we present an automated pipeline for the discovery and description of the generative narrative frameworks of conspiracy theories that circulate on social media, and actual conspiracies reported in the news media. We base this work on two separate comprehensive repositories of blog posts and news articles describing the well-known conspiracy theory Pizzagate from 2016, and the New Jersey political conspiracy Bridgegate from 2013. Inspired by the qualitative narrative theory of Greimas, we formulate a graphical generative machine learning model where nodes represent actors/actants, and multi-edges and self-loops among nodes capture context-specific relationships. Posts and news items are viewed as samples of subgraphs of the hidden narrative framework network. The problem of reconstructing the underlying narrative structure is then posed as a latent model estimation problem. To derive the narrative frameworks in our target corpora, we automatically extract and aggregate the actants (people, places, objects) and their relationships from the posts and articles. We capture context specific actants and interactant relationships by developing a system of supernodes and subnodes. We use these to construct an actant-relationship network, which constitutes the underlying generative narrative framework for …",

        "abstract": "Background: Social media offer an unprecedented opportunity to explore how people talk about health care at a very large scale. Numerous studies have shown the importance of websites with user forums for people seeking information related to health. Parents turn to some of these sites, colloquially referred to as “mommy blogs,” to share concerns about children’s health care, including vaccination. Although substantial work has considered the role of social media, particularly Twitter, in discussions of vaccination and other health care–related issues, there has been little work on describing the underlying structure of these discussions and the role of persuasive storytelling, particularly on sites with no limits on post length. Understanding the role of persuasive storytelling at Internet scale provides useful insight into how people discuss vaccinations, including exemption-seeking behavior, which has been tied to a recent diminution of herd immunity in some communities.Objective: To develop an automated and scalable machine-learning method for story aggregation on social media sites dedicated to discussions of parenting. We wanted to discover the aggregate narrative frameworks to which individuals, through their exchange of experiences and commentary, contribute over time in a particular topic domain. We also wanted to characterize temporal trends in these narrative frameworks on the sites over the study period.Methods: To ensure that our data capture long-term discussions and not short-term reactions to recent events, we developed a dataset of 1.99 million posts contributed by 40,056 users and viewed 20.12 million times indexed from …",

Furthermore, the semiconducting polymer nanoparticles possess high structural flexibility, narrow photoacoustic spectral profiles and strong resistance to photodegradation and oxidation, enabling the development of the first near-infrared …",

Here we present quantum dot conjugates that luminesce by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer in the absence of external excitation. The conjugates are prepared by coupling carboxylate-presenting quantum dots to a mutant of the bioluminescent protein Renilla reniformis luciferase. We show that the conjugates emit long-wavelength (from red to near-infrared) bioluminescent light in cells and in animals, even in deep tissues, and are suitable for multiplexed in vivo imaging.

Whether such declines reduce crop yields, or are mitigated by managed pollinators such as honey bees, is unclear. We found universally positive associations of fruit set with flower visitation by wild insects in 41 crop systems worldwide. In contrast, fruit set increased significantly with flower visitation by honey bees in only 14% of the systems surveyed. Overall, wild insects pollinated crops more effectively; an increase in wild insect visitation enhanced fruit set by twice as much as an equivalent increase in honey bee visitation. Visitation by wild insects and honey bees promoted fruit set independently, so pollination by managed honey bees supplemented, rather than substituted for, pollination by wild insects.

In a synchronic perspective, memory's entangledness is presented as twofold. Every act of remembering inscribes an individual in multiple social frames. This polyphony entails the simultaneous existence of concurrent interpretations of the past. In a diachronic perspective, memory is entangled in the dynamic relation between single acts of remembering and changing mnemonic patterns. Memory scholars therefore uncover boundless cross‐referential configurations. Wishing to enhance …",

Individual stories can be conceptualized as samples from an underlying mixture of competing narratives. The automated identification of these distinct narratives from unstructured text is a fundamental yet difficult task in Computational Linguistics since narratives are often intertwined and only implicitly conveyed in text. In this paper, we consider a more feasible proxy task: Identify the distinct sets of aligned story actors responsible for sustaining the issue-specific narratives. Discovering aligned actors, and the groups these alignments create, brings us closer to estimating the narrative that each group represents. With the help of Large Language Models (LLM), we address this task by:(i) Introducing a corpus of text segments rich in narrative content associated with six different current issues;(ii) Introducing a novel two-step graph-based framework that (a) identifies alignments between actors (INCANT) and (b) extracts aligned actor groups using the network structure (TAMPA). Amazon Mechanical Turk evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Across domains, alignment relationships from INCANT are accurate (macro F1>= 0.75) and actor groups from TAMPA are preferred over 2 non-trivial baseline models (ACC>= 0.75).",

        "abstract": " ABSTRACT: This study examines European stock market reactions to 16 events associated with the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in Europe. European IFRS adoption represented a major milestone toward financial reporting convergence yet spurred controversy reaching the highest levels of government. We find an incrementally positive reaction for firms with lower quality pre‐adoption information, which is more pronounced for banks, and with higher pre‐adoption information asymmetry, consistent with investors expecting net information quality benefits from IFRS adoption. We find an incrementally negative reaction for firms domiciled in code law countries, consistent with investors' concerns over enforcement of IFRS in those countries. Finally, we find a positive reaction to IFRS adoption events for firms with high‐quality pre‐adoption information, consistent with investors …",

Similar to other investment opportunities that involve risky expected cash flows, unresolved agency problems may lead managers to engage in more or less corporate tax avoidance than shareholders would otherwise prefer. Consistent with the mixed results reported in prior studies, we find no relation between various corporate governance mechanisms and tax avoidance at the conditional mean and median of the tax avoidance distribution. However, using quantile regression, we find a positive relation between board independence and financial sophistication for low levels of tax avoidance, but a negative relation for high levels of tax avoidance. These results indicate that these governance attributes have a stronger relation with more extreme levels of tax avoidance, which are more likely to be symptomatic …",

With rapidly shrinking process feature sizes, wire delay is becoming a large fraction of the overall delay of a circuit. Additionally, the increasing cross-coupling capacitances between wires on the same metal layer create a situation where the delay of a wire is strongly dependent on the electrical state of its neighboring wires. The delay of a wire can vary widely depending on whether its neighbors perform a like or unlike transition. This effect is acute for long on-chip buses. In this work, we classify cross-talk interactions between the wires of an on-chip bus. We present encoding techniques which can help a designer trade off cross-talk against area overhead. Our experimental results show that the proposed techniques result in reduced delay variation due to cross-talk. As a result, the overall delay of a bus actually decreases even after the use …",

Our implementation fault-simulates all the gates in a particular level of a circuit, including good and faulty circuit simulations, for all patterns, in parallel. Since GPUs have an extremely large memory bandwidth, we implement each of our fault simulation threads (which execute in parallel with no data dependencies) using memory lookup. Fault injection is also done along with gate evaluation, with each thread using a different fault injection mask. All threads compute identical instructions, but on different data, as required by the Single Instruction Multiple Data …",

Drawing on participant action research and observation, this paper engages with the projects underway at the Parque—as well as “indigenous biocultural heritage” (IBCH), the original action-framework guiding the Parque’s work.

Drawing on a history of the U.S. Farm Bill, this paper argues that a fixation on farm subsidies ignores why they came into being, and more generally glosses over the imperative for modern states to intervene into agricultural economies. Karl Polanyi's 'double movement' framework is used to situate the rise and fall of agricultural supply management within food regime theory. In the second, or surplus food regime, the U.S. government wielded excess commodities as geopolitical tools—even as domestic farm policy labored to contain overproduction, and thus support agrarian viability. In the subsequent corporate food regime, “free market” agriculture displaces and discredits supply management, even as massive …",

We provide the first direct experimental evidence for dry adhesion of gecko setae by van der Waals forces, and reject the use of mechanisms relying on high surface polarity, including capillary adhesion. The toes of live Tokay geckos were highly hydrophobic, and adhered equally well to strongly hydrophobic and strongly hydrophilic, polarizable surfaces. Adhesion of a single isolated gecko seta was equally effective on the hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces of a microelectro-mechanical systems force sensor.

The bias electric field pulls the electron wave function away from the dopant ion into layers of different alloy composition. Owing to the variation of the g factor (Si: g= 1.998, Ge: g= 1.563), this displacement changes the spin Zeeman energy, allowing single-qubit operations. By displacing the electron even further, the overlap with neighboring qubits is affected, which allows two-qubit operations.

Since managers can often choose the period during which an asset will be sold, and since the principle of acquisition cost underlying the accounting valuation of assets implies that changes in the market value of an asset between acquisition and sale are reported in the period of sale, it follows that there are opportunities for managers to manipulate earnings through the timing of asset sales at relatively low cost. Two common explanations for earnings manipulations are examined: the earnings-smoothing and the debt-equity hypotheses.1 The earnings-smoothing hypothesis predicts that earnings are manipulated to reduce fluctuations around some level that is considered normal for the firm (see, e.g., Ronen and …",

However, the ever increasing demands on passengers' comfort, safety, emissions, and fuel consumption imposed by car manufacturers and regulations call for more robust techniques and the use of cycle-accurate models. We argue that these models must be hybrid because of the combination of time-domain and event-based behaviors. We present a hybrid model of the engine in which both continuous and discrete time-domain as well as event-based phenomena are modeled in a separate but integrated manner. Based on this model, we formalize the specification of the overall engine control by defining a number of hybrid control problems. To cope with the difficulties arising in the design of hybrid controllers, a design …",

The wide variety of motions performed by the human arm during daily tasks makes it desirable to find representative subsets to reduce the dimensionality of these movements for a variety of applications, including the design and control of robotic and prosthetic devices. This paper presents a novel method and the results of an extensive human subjects study to obtain representative arm joint angle trajectories that span naturalistic motions during Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). In particular, we seek to identify sets of useful motion trajectories of the upper limb that are functions of a single variable, allowing, for instance, an entire prosthetic or robotic arm to be controlled with a single input from a user, along with a means to select between motions for different tasks.

In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a concept we call  trajectory control , that builds upon this approach, in which motions of the wrist, elbow, and shoulder DOFs (and subsets of them) are coupled into predefined sets of coordinated trajectories; to be selected by the user and driven with a single input variable.

Consistent with prior research, we treat audit quality as a dichotomous variable and assume that Big Six auditors are of higher quality than non‐Big Six auditors. Earnings management is captured by discretionary accruals that are estimated using a cross‐sectional version of the Jones 1991 model. Prior literature suggests that auditors are more likely to object to management's accounting choices that increase earnings (as opposed to decrease earnings) and that auditors are more likely to be sued when they are associated with financial statements that overstate earnings (as compared to understate earnings). Therefore, we hypothesize that clients of non‐Big Six auditors report discretionary accruals that increase income relatively more than the discretionary accruals reported by clients of Big Six auditors.

Here, the associated control scheme enables active decoupling of wrist and finger articulation, which can be useful during certain phases of manipulation tasks. An additional modification to the traditional WDO is the integration of a magnetic latch at the Distal Interphalangeal (DIP) joint allowing for improved pinching. These abilities are demonstrated with common activities of daily living (ADL).",

Values of β, a parameter reflecting the dependence of electron transfer on distance, ranged from 0.1 to 1.0 per angstrom. Strong stacking interactions result in the fastest electron-transfer kinetics. Electrons are thus transported preferentially through an intrastrand rather than interstrand pathway. Reactant energetics also modulate the distance dependence of DNA-mediated charge transport.

These women interact with host Nam Hui-seok, an additional female co-host (or, in the earlier episodes, two), and a panel composed of four male South Korean entertainers. Episodes typically open in a lighthearted manner, with conversation about daily life in North Korea alongside mild flirtation between the Southern male and Northern female participants, often involving song and dance, but climax with a talbuk seuteori, an emotionally harrowing narrative from one of the border-crossers detailing her exodus from North Korea. Via this framework Ije mannareo gamnida attempts to nurture the integration of North Korean refugees into South Korean society; personalization of their plight occurs in conjunction with reminders of a shared Korean identity maintained despite the regime they have fled, which is depicted as cruel, repressive and backward.

In response, increasing the general adaptive capacity of farming systems is essential. We identify two divergent strategies for building adaptive capacity. Simplifying processes seek to narrowly maximize production by shifting the basis of agricultural production toward centralized control of socially and ecologically homogenized systems. Diversifying processes cultivate social-ecological complexity in order to provide multiple ecosystem services, maintain management flexibility, and promote coordinated adaptation across levels. Through five primarily United States focused cases of distinct agricultural challenges—foodborne pathogens, drought, marginal lands, labor availability, and land access and tenure—we compare simplifying and diversifying responses to assess how these pathways differentially enhance or degrade the adaptive capacity of farming systems in the context of the triple threat. These cases show that diversifying processes can weave a form of broad and nimble adaptive capacity that is fundamentally distinct from the narrow and brittle adaptive capacity produced through simplification. We find that while there are structural limitations and tradeoffs to diversifying processes, adaptive capacity can be facilitated by empowering people and enhancing ecosystem functionality to proactively distribute resources and knowledge where needed and to nimbly respond to changing circumstances. Our cases suggest that, in order to garner the most adaptive benefits from diversification, farming systems should balance the pursuit of multiple goals …",

        "abstract": "In the past few decades, farmers and researchers have firmly established that biologically diversified farming systems improve ecosystem services both on and off the farm, producing economic benefits for farmers and ecological benefits for surrounding landscapes. However, adoption of these practices has been slow, requiring a more nuanced examination of both barriers and opportunities to improve adoption rates. While previous research has demonstrated that both individual and structural factors shape farmers' decisions about whether to adopt diversification practices, this study aims to understand the interaction of these individual and structural factors, and how they relate to farm scale. Based on 20 interviews with organic lettuce growers on the Central Coast of California, as well as 8 interviews with technical assistance providers who work with these growers, we constructed a typology to help elucidate the distinct contexts that shape growers' decisions about diversification practices. This typology, which reflects the structural influence of land rent and supply chains, divides growers into three categories: limited resource, mid-scale diversified, or wholesale. In this economic context, limited resource and wholesale growers both experience significant barriers that constrain the adoption of diversification practices, while some mid-scale diversified growers have found a “sweet spot” for managing agroecosystems that can succeed in both economic and ecological terms.

        "abstract": "Self-assembled DNA nanostructures enable nanometre-precise patterning that can be used to create programmable molecular machines,,,, and arrays of functional materials,,. DNA origami is particularly versatile in this context because each DNA strand in the origami nanostructure occupies a unique position and can serve as a uniquely addressable pixel. However, the scale of such structures,,, has been limited to about 0.05 square micrometres, hindering applications that demand a larger layout and integration with more conventional patterning methods. Hierarchical multistage assembly of simple sets of tiles, can in principle overcome this limitation, but so far has not been sufficiently robust to enable successful implementation of larger structures using DNA origami tiles. Here we show that by using simple local assembly rules that are modified and applied recursively throughout a hierarchical, multistage …",

        "title": "Bioorthogonal cyclization-mediated in situ self-assembly of small-molecule probes for imaging caspase activity in vivo",
        "abstract": "Directed self-assembly of small molecules in living systems could enable a myriad of applications in biology and medicine, and already this has been used widely to synthesize supramolecules and nano/microstructures in solution and in living cells. However, controlling the self-assembly of synthetic small molecules in living animals is challenging because of the complex and dynamic in vivo physiological environment. Here we employ an optimized first-order bioorthogonal cyclization reaction to control the self-assembly of a fluorescent small molecule, and demonstrate its in vivo applicability by imaging caspase-3/7 activity in human tumour xenograft mouse models of chemotherapy. The fluorescent nanoparticles assembled in situ were imaged successfully in both apoptotic cells and tumour tissues using three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy. This strategy combines the advantages offered by small …",

        "abstract": " Purpose: The presence of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) in breast cancer correlates strongly with poor outcome. The purpose of this study was to develop a clinically applicable, noninvasive diagnostic assay for selective targeting and visualization of TAMs in breast cancer, based on magnetic resonanceI and clinically applicable iron oxide nanoparticles. Experimental Design: F4/80-negative mammary carcinoma cells and F4/80-positive TAMs were incubated with iron oxide nanoparticles and were compared with respect to magnetic resonance signal changes and iron uptake. MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice harboring mammary carcinomas underwent nanoparticle-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) up to 1 hour and 24 hours after injection. The tumor enhancement on MRIs was correlated with the presence and location of TAMs and nanoparticles by confocal microscopy …",
